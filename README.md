📄 frontend‑integration


A full‑featured vanilla JavaScript frontend originally built to integrate with a custom API.

🚀 Overview
frontend‑integration is a large‑scale frontend application built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, designed to consume a custom API that I developed from scratch. The backend eventually expanded to over 80 endpoints, covering authentication, data operations, pagination, and more.

After a major backend refactor, the API’s structure changed significantly. Rather than updating this frontend to match the new backend, the main UI is now being rebuilt in React for long‑term scalability.

This repository remains as a complete, standalone project showcasing advanced frontend logic without frameworks.

🛠️ Features
API Integration: Originally built to consume a large custom backend

Pagination: Smooth client‑side pagination for large datasets

Loading States: Visual indicators during async operations

Error Handling: Graceful fallback UI for failed requests

Dynamic Rendering: DOM updates based on user interactions

Modular Architecture: Reusable utilities and organized code structure

Responsive UI: Works across devices

Zero Frameworks: Pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Large Codebase: Over 2,000 lines of code, with nearly 50% JavaScript

🧩 Background
This project began as the frontend for a full‑stack system where I built both the backend API and the UI from scratch. As the API evolved and was later refactored, the original frontend no longer aligned with the updated backend.

Instead of rewriting it, I transitioned to building a new frontend in React.

frontend‑integration now stands as:

A demonstration of raw JavaScript capability

A reference for building complex UI without frameworks

A snapshot of the project’s earlier architecture

⚙️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/CodeEmmanuel-beep/frontend-integration.git

2. Open the project folder

3. Launch index.html in your browser

🔌 API Information
This project was originally built to consume a custom API with 80+ endpoints.
The backend has since been refactored, and the main frontend is now being rebuilt in React.

This repository remains as a standalone demonstration of the original frontend logic.
